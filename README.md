This is a simple banner grabber. This script has
a lot to get improved at but as they say let's start 
small. I'm just new so pls be kind and thank you for
appreciating my code.

At first it will try to install neofetch, you can 
just comment '#' that out if you already had neofetch.

Tested on Debian Linux and Termux app on Android.


Usage:

python3 dgrabber.py


Testing:

Test dgrabber with netcat on the other side with nc -v -l [port] 
try typing anything on netcat's side and it will be grabbed
by dgrabber on the other side.
It's a simple testing to prove it works. :)
